# CSS Parser

## Description
This project is a C++ console application designed to parse CSS files and execute various commands to query and manipulate the parsed data.
The application reads CSS input, parses it into structured sections, and allows for querying selectors and attributes, 
counting occurrences, and deleting specific sections or attributes. 
The program utilizes custom data structures like doubly linked lists and block lists to manage the CSS data efficiently.
